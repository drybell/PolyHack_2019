# PolyHack_2019
Collaborative Work done during PolyHack_2019 with Jamie Weiss

# Inside the demo folder..
There's html files with our data visualization, txt files that hold data that we created using ls commands,
and py scripts that strip data and build the model using plolty. More work to integrate this project with
Terminal to come
